## Deploy

### On a Local Testnet network with mocked messaging service

In a first terminal, run:

```shell
npx hardhat node
```

In a second terminal, run:

```shell
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/tokenBridge/test/deployMock.ts
```

### On a Goerli Testnet network with mocked messaging service

In a terminal, run:

```shell
npx hardhat run --network goerli scripts/tokenBridge/test/deployMock.ts
```

### On Goerli Testnet and Goerli Linea Testnet

To deploy the contracts, you will need to run the Bridged Token, Token Bridge, and Token Bridge operational scripts.

You can refer to the following links that describe the usage of these scripts. <br />
- [Bridged Token Deployment Script](./deployment.md#bridgedtoken) <br />
- [Token Bridge Deployment Script](./deployment.md#tokenbridge) <br />
- [Operational Script](./operational.md#transferownershipandsetremotetokenbridge)


All addresses created will be stored in the deployments folder as a separate file. `./contracts/deployment/<network_name>`

## Development

### Testing

To run tests, execute:

```shell
npm run test
```

or

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

### Test coverage

This project uses the Hardhat plugin [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage/blob/master/HARDHAT_README.md) to assess the overall coverage of the unit tests.
To generate a boilerplate report, use the following command:

```shell
npm run coverage
```

or

```shell
npx hardhat coverage --solcoverjs ./.solcover.js
```

The report will be generated in the `coverage` folder at the root of the repository. To visualize it in your web browser, you can use the `coverage/index.html` file.
Note: the second command line might not work if the folder `coverage` already exists. If you encounter an issue, please delete the whole `coverage` folder and let hardhat-coverage regenerate a new one.

### Contract verification on Etherscan

To verify the contract on Etherscan.

```shell
 npx hardhat verify --network NETWORK DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor argument 1" "Constructor argument 2"
```

### Gas Estimation

You can estimate the contracts gas costs.

- On a terminal start a local node:

```shell
npx hardhat node
```

- On another terminal, execute the gas estimation script:

```shell
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/tokenBridge/gasEstimation/gasEstimation.ts
```

It should return gas estimation:

```shell
basic bridgeToken:                            162080
bridgeToken with permit:                      243910
bridgeToken after confirmDeploy:              126453
bridgeToken with permit after confirmDeploy:  202909
```
